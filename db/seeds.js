We have helped people who are stateless and have other nationality issues secure more certain future. At MRC, our roots are in the migrant communities that we serve. Our services are delivered by a wide range of skilled and dedicated volunteers who come from all over the world. And most of our staff are themselves migrants or the children of migrants. Many started as service users or volunteers before joining the staff, and therefore understand the challenges our clients face. We are proud to see ourselves as a migrant-led organisation. But we also see ourselves as an integral part of the British communities in which we live. While our first mandate is to support migrants to integrate into British society, we know that integration must be a two-way process. And for this reason, we reach out to use our skills and time to support all members of the community in need, whether they are migrants or not. And we work closely with organisations representing other members of the community to address shared challenges.',
